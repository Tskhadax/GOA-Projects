    <p><h2>Salad "My Fair Lady":</h2></p>    
    <p>Tender, light, delicious - the salad "My Fair Lady" has all the advantages! This recipe - the salad "Lady" - was borrowed by me from my mother-in-law, for which I am very grateful to her. Since then, the salad "My Fair Lady" has helped me out more than once when guests came unexpectedly. It turns out to be an excellent New Year's salad!</p>
